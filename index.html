                those
                books.
                However, I am mainly working at Nokia as a Software Engineer and Web Developer. I also teach web

            <p class="right-pad">Going with what our body wants, or force the body to do what our mind wants? So, which
                part do we want to
                make free: body or mind? If we decide for body being free we will end up being a prisoner of our
                idleness. Moreover, most often we will feel guilty of why we are not doing anything, and this parasite -
                guilt - will deplete us innerly and make us feel like we are in hell.</p>
